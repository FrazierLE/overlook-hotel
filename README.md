#Overlook Hotel

## Abstract
Overlook Hotel is an interactive, web-based application that allows users to log into their account and book a hotel room. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs, we built our app to allow users to view their upcoming bookings, previous bookings, and the total amount of dollars spent on previous bookings. Users are also able to select a date, filter the room type, and check the availability of rooms before booking one.

### Learning Goals
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Wins
- Fetching the data on the first try
- Iterating through the different data sets to get the results I wanted to

### Challenges
- Actually displaying the data from the POST network request
- Getting the username and password to log in the user or deliver an error message
